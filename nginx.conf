# we need to select the upstream based on a querystring parameter. That parameter

#
# ASSUMPTION: the 0.19 package site will have enough information for people using
# 0.18 to browse their packages.
#
# Syntax note: `map` is Nginx's equivalent of a `case` or `switch`. So...

#        case source of
#             "foo" -> "bar"
#             _     -> "baz"

# version in the querystring this is not terrible.

# elm-lang.org with the includeSubdomains flag) until 0.18 is no longer
